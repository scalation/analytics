 
Data Set Information:

This dataset was constructed by adding elevation information to a 2D road network in North Jutland, 
Denmark (covering a region of 185 x 135 km^2). Elevation values where extracted from a publicly available 
massive Laser Scan Point Cloud for Denmark (available at : [Web Link] (Bottom-most dataset)). This 3D road 
network was eventually used for benchmarking various fuel and CO2 estimation algorithms. This dataset can be 
used by any applications that require to know very accurate elevation information of a road network to 
perform more accurate routing for eco-routing, cyclist routes etc. For the data mining and machine learning 
community, this dataset can be used as 'ground-truth' validation in spatial mining techniques and satellite 
image processing. It has no class labels, but can be used in unsupervised learning and regression to guess 
some missing elevation information for some points on the road. The work was supported by the Reduction 
project that is funded by the European Comission as FP7-ICT-2011-7 STREP project number 288254.

Attribute Information:



1. OSM_ID: OpenStreetMap ID for each road segment or edge in the graph.
2. LONGITUDE: Web Mercaptor (Google format) longitude
3. LATITUDE: Web Mercaptor (Google format) latitude
4. ALTITUDE: Height in meters.

Note: OSM_ID is the ID assigned by OpenStreetMaps ([Web Link]) to the road segments. Each (long,lat,altitude) 
point on a road segment (with unique OSM ID) is sorted in the same order as they appear on the road. So a 
3D-polyline can be drawn by joining points of each row for each OSM_ID road segment.
