 
Data Set Information:

The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of 
attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.



Attribute Information:

This problem has the following inputs:
1. Frequency, in Hertzs.
2. Angle of attack, in degrees.
3. Chord length, in meters.
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.

The only output is:
6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.
